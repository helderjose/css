Definition and Usage
The font-family property specifies the font for an element.
The font-family property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser
does not support the first font, it tries the next font (da esquerda para direita).


There are two types of font family names:
* family-name - The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.
* generic-family - The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif",
"cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".
Start with the font you want, and always end with a generic family, to
let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.

Note: Separate each value with a comma.
Note: If a font name contains white-space, it must be quoted. Single
quotes must be used when using the "style" attribute in HTML.
